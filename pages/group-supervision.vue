               description="Mind, Body & Breath Coach, UK">
    <p>I felt seen, heard and appreciated. The session were well structured and at the same time free enough for me to bring what I wanted to the session. So many areas of my coaching have improved - contracting, brining the session back on track and handling specific client questions.</p>

  <Testimonial author="Helen Kartika"
               description="Business & Mindset Coach, Germany">
    <p>When you're in a supervision session with Kris, prepare to go DEEP! Prepare for thought-provoking 'aha' moments and rich, intellectually stimulating conversation- Kris really knows her stuff! One moment we'll be talking about Freud, Gestalt or transactional analysis, the next we'll be talking about Human Design and moon phases. It's incredible the depth and breadth of knowledge and modalities Kris will utilise to guide you on whatever it is you're trying to solve or understand. Kris also has an intuitive knack for digging under the surface of whatever it is you bring to the group, which pushes you to expand your knowledge, think outside of the box and deepen your curiosity so that you have the springboard to further explore and integrate the topics beyond the supervision session itself.</p>
  </Testimonial>

  <h2>What is coaching supervision</h2>
  <p>Supervision is an ICF-recognised practice for excellence. It's what helps coaches move from 'good enough' to masterful. It's what helps you resolve your challenges, restore your energy, serve your clients more effectively, grow as a coach, and ultimately, become a more confident and competence practitioner.</p>

  <p>What can I bring to supervision</p>
  <ul class="list-disc">
    <li>Client cases and challenging situations to make sure you serve your clients effectively</li>
    <li>Confidence wobbles, imposter feelings and self-esteem issues that prevent you from owning your coaching abilities and strengths</li>
    <li>Business development issues to create a flourishing coaching business (offers, packages, pricing, messaging)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>>What we address in our work, i.e. 3 elements of coaching mastery</p>
  <ul class="list-disc">
    <li>Coaching mastery (nuts n bolts of coaching)</li>
    <li>Self-mastery (deep inner work for the outer success)</li>
    <li>Business mastery (entrepreneurial mindset to succeed as a heart-centered coach)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>What is the result</p>
  <p>Based on 4 years of experience as a coaching supervisor, common benefits of regular supervision are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Better client outcomes</li>
    <li>Solid reputation</li>
    <li>Increased referral rate (spend less time marketing and more time living)</li>
    <li>Greater sense of competence</li>
    <li>And feeling way more confident as a coach</li>
  </ul>

  <Testimonial author="Helen Kartika"
               description="Business & Mindset Coach, Germany">
    <p>I'm far more comfortable just being my authentic self as a coach which has significantly increased my confidence and the outcomes I'm able to support my clients with. Bringing more of myself into my coaching practice has also allowed for more ease, more flow and simply being able to enjoy my work as a coach more.</p>
  </Testimonial>

  <p>The beauty of group supervision:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc">
    <li>Supportive Community: Connect with a supportive community of coaches who are committed to your success. Share insights, celebrate wins, and collaborate on solutions to common coaching challenges.</li>
    <li>Belonging (not fitting in): No longer feel alone with your problems and form meaningful connections and friendships with fellow coaches who are on this journey with you.</li>
    <li>Affordability: groups supervision is the most accessible way to get the support you need to become the best coach you can be and flourish in your coaching business.</li>
  </ul>
