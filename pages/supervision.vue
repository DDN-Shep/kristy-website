  <p>If you're here, you're likely a coach, leader, or professional who's committed to growth. Maybe you've already had some success, but something feels… stuck. The deeper questions are surfacing:</p>
  <p>How can I better support my clients? How do I take my practice to the next level? And why, despite all my efforts, does it still feel like I'm hustling too hard?</p>
  <p>I get it. Building a coaching practice (or any service-based business) that feels deeply fulfilling and profitable isn't easy. But the truth is, the answer doesn't lie in doing more. It's about going deeper.</p>

  <h2>Mastery Begins Here</h2>
  <p>Hi, I'm Kris. I specialize in working with passionate, heart-centered coaches and professionals who are ready to step into their full potential. My mission is to help you find your true alignment, so you can build a business that feels effortless, authentic, and profoundly impactful.</p>
  <p>Through supervision, coaching, and deep reflective work, I help coaches like you hone your craft, embrace your unique voice, and master the art of coaching from the inside out. Because the truth is, the outer success you seek starts with deep inner work.</p>

  <h2>How I Can Help You</h2>
  <p>In our work together, we'll focus on three key elements of mastery:</p>
  <p>Coaching Mastery: We'll refine your approach, help you uncover blind spots, and elevate your skills to ensure you're providing transformative experiences for your clients.</p>
  <p>Self-Mastery: Together, we'll dive into the inner work that's necessary for your personal and professional growth. This is where you'll overcome self-doubt, reconnect with your ‘why,' and tap into your resilience.</p>
  <p>Business Mastery: Whether you're just starting or looking to expand, I'll support you in developing a sustainable, values-driven coaching practice that's aligned with who you are and the impact you want to make.</p>

  <p>Testimonial: “A gift of supervision is that I have this space to go to, where I resolve my challenges, grow as a coach, become less of a perfectionist, reconnect with my strengths, and come out feeling clearer and better about it.” - Productivity Coach for neurodivergent folks.</p>

  <h2>Is This You?</h2>
  <p>You're already an experienced coach or leader, but you're ready for more - deeper insights, greater impact, and higher satisfaction in your work.</p>
  <p>You're craving a supportive, honest space where you can explore your challenges and sharpen your skills.</p>
  <p>You want to stop second-guessing yourself and build a practice that feels truly aligned with your values, not just the market's demands.</p>
  <p>If that resonates, then you're in the right place.</p>

  <h2>Let's Work Together</h2>
  <p>Whether it's through group supervision, one-on-one coaching, or business mentorship, I'll support you in finding clarity and confidence as you step into the next chapter of your coaching journey.</p>
  <p>I see Supervision as a collaborative journey — a shared space where coach and supervisor meet as equals, fostering growth and discovery. Together, we create a nurturing environment where you can restore, re-energize, and gain fresh insights into both your client practice and business. Through reflective dialogue, we'll explore any challenges you're facing, uphold professional and ethical standards, and reignite your passion for the work you do.</p>
  <p>Whether we connect virtually or in person, I bring deep presence, years of supervision experience, and unwavering support. You bring your openness, curiosity, and commitment to growth. Together, we achieve real transformation.</p>
  <p>Supervision fees for independent coaches: £225 per session (75-90 mins), or £2k annual subscription for 10 sessions of individual supervision (save £250). Interest-free payment plans are available.</p>
